However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from\nrepeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical\npipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full\ncontext-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to\ninefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution\nfor avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes\nremain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to\ndiverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify\nthat the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.\nTo address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables\nefficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning\ncache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM\nestimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of\ncached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under\nvarying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing\ndynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM\nachieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including\nretrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,\nall without quality degradation.

Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "RID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uace0\uc218\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc791\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0-\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc608\uc678\ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 20\uac1c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc77c\uce58 \uc810\uc218(95%)\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc811\uadfc\uc131 \ub192\uc740 LLM \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action\nDecisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which\nagents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\nbenchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model\noutperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 AOAD-MAT\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uae30\uc874\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc774\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc11c\ube0c\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c \ud589\ub3d9\uc790\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uacb0\ud569, AOAD-\uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud06c\ub798\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ubb34\uc870\ucf54 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c AOAD-MAT\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

In\nthis work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of\npseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the\ncone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the\ninterplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically\nlow-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce\n\\textit{\\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue\nand improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches.

As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain\ndistinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model\npreserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a\nunified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term\nforecasting performance.

Extended version", "summary": "Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and\nconvenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,\nrecent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic\naccuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training\nenvironment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning\nmethods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they\noften struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the\ntraining setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of\ndisease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and\nenvironment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative\nto task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning\nframework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),\ngrounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a\nlimited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and\nleverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess\nTMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset\ncomprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21\ndiseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just\n10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models\ntrained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned\nwith these target samples after pre-training on source data.

At the same time, modern deep\nRL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.\nWhile pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its\nrole in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first\ntheoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in\nstate-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and\ncategorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise\npruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the\npolicy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret\ndecomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced\nperformance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental\nperformance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and\nmicro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong\npolicy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers\nreproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness\nimproves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean\nperformance.

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods.

CI-EX iteratively identifies the\ndistribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and\nassigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the\naccepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised\nclassification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated\nthrough experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is\nevaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics\nsuch as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area\nunder the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed\nframework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.\nHowever, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI\nmodels from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while\nmaintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Reject Inference (RI) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 CI-EX \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 RI \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 RI \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "motivation": "Reject Inference\uc758 \ubaa8\uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 rejected \uc0d8\ud50c \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30.", "method": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \ud655\ub960 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec rejected \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubc0f \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c CI-EX\ub294 \uae30\uc874 RI \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 RI \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, AUC \uc131\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub460.", "conclusion": "CI-EX\ub294 rejected \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec RI \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c RI-\ud2b9\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud568."}}

To\nbridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nsequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully\ndesigned dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with\n2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.\nAdditionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic\nevaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and\ntemporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based\nmetric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through\nsystematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current\nT2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action\nsequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and\ndifficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between\nsequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for\nevaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights\nfor improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

However, existing motion generation approaches\naddress either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since\nconstructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and\nprecise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce\nSceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned\nmotion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets\nthrough two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The\nkey idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task\nto bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to\ntext-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that\nmodulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.\nIn the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene\ngeometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.\nExperimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness\ninto text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which\nthis awareness emerges.

The research\ncommunity and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep\nLearning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles\n(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately\nperceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to\ncontrol the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based\nanalytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the\ndriving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom\ndataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a\nDL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the\nutility of perception service from the performance values of trained model\ninstances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection\ntask, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'\nperformance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show\nthree best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,\nSGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822).

This\nstiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated\nwith other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit\nschemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies\nto alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural\noperators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable\noperator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences\nin the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,\nAdaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator\ncapable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring\nreliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states\nfrom given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within\nthe framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize\nthe loss function.

Under review by IEEE", "summary": "Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory\nmodels to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of\nhuman-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game\nmodel where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the\ninput (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based\non these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically\nimpose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired\ngeneration. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode\ncollapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator\nconsistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing\nstudies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,\nlacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit\ncooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and\nidentify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends\nto explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading\nthe system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions\nv.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel\napproach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),\nwhich progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game\nequilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a\nmore optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a\nsuboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and\ntwo synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud569\ub9ac\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc778 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PORAT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\ub9ac\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d.", "result": "9\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ub450 \uc778\uacf5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 8.1% \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub9ac\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c."}}

Existing data-driven framework have\nadvanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically\nconditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,\nthese models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of\ncell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in\nspurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable\ngene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design\nframeworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,\nan approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to\nescape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this\nwork, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for\nsingle-cell perturbation modeling.

We\nintroduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that\ninserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge\nthe distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used\nfor drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across\nmodels, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly\nsmaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds\non fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each\nstage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x\ngeneration speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer\nGPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an\n8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved\nthroughput.

Thus, an end-to-end\nmachine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,\nindustrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the\nchallenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow\nconsisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution\nalignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order\nHelmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive\ndataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively\ninexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion\nmodels which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set\nof full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)\nreal-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,\ni.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution\nrepresentations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed\nby the inversion models.

Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible\nmethodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders\nprogress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for\ndesigning next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which\nwe term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect\nnumber of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six\nfingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this\nend, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting\ncriteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,\nwe develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting\nhallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in\nDPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial\nnoise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their\ncorrelation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this\nwidely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations\nconsistently.

While prior work has demonstrated that\nLLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and\npersonalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic\nattributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first\nlarge-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation\ngeneration by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically\nevaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A\nkey novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion\ndataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324\ndisinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four\nmajor languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic\ndimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting\npersonalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the\ndimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation\nattributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple\npersonalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the\nlikelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised\nprompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the\npersuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives.

We\nargue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,\nwhere latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This\ntension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:\nconstructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.\nRethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent\nmutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may\ncause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,\nexpressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such\ncollapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an\ninformation-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this\ntradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian\nformulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a\nstable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative\nevaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our\nrepresentations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical\npredictions.

Recent machine\nlearning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be\nextended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present\nGlobal MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It\nleverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary\nsatellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12\nhours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\\deg}\n(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly\noutperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly\nhigher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than\npreviously available.

Given the inherent difference in information\nentropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an\nimbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this\nparticular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment\nability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved\nthrough a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on\nexplicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the\npolysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy\nof the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A\nhypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the\ntext and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching\nerrors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst\nreducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced\ndimensions back to the original dimensions.

In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving\nand e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can\nreliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to\nbankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic\nalternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc21c \ucc28\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc774 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc548\uc804-\uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc774\ub860\uc744 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uad50\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc774\ub098 \ud30c\uc0b0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uce58\uba85\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacfc\uc81c \uc218\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucc28\ub2e8 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

The proposed approach with\nhigher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%\n(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot\nprompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that\ncombining representative example selection with increased temperature provides\nthe appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble.

While\nrecent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,\nthese models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario\ndata, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from\ndifferent geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation.

Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that\nemphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS\nexplicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches\ninapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel\nGS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view\ncontributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn\nrequires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this\npaper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)\nstrategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client\nfor loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication\nresources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients.

Prior methods\n(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade\nacceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror\nSpeculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the\nlatency-acceptance tradeoff.

The draft speculates forward continuations for the\ntarget to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths\nfor the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution\npipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,\nwe add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This\ndual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative\nstreaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high\nacceptance with low overhead.

However, there has been\nlittle work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is\nencapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.\nThis is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw\nsource code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we\npropose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy\ngraph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on\nScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of\nScratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space.

Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm\nand emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the\ngenerated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.\nExperimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods\nshowcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uc124 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac1c\uc131\uc788\ub294 3D \uc778\uac04 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc2e0\uccb4 \ubd80\uc704\ubcc4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uacfc \uac10\uc815 \ubc0f \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc74c\uc131 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uac1c\uc778 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c, \uc2e0\uccb4 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \ud45c\uc815\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c 3D \uc778\uac04 \ubaa8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uccb4\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd80\uc704\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uacfc \ub9ac\ub4ec, \uac10\uc815\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\ud2b8\ubcc4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc778\uc81d\uc158\uacfc \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c MimicParts \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 3D \uc778\uac04 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70,Region \ubcc4 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \uac10\uc815\uacfc \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\uccb4 \uac01 \ubd80\uc704\ubcc4\ub85c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uacfc \uac10\uc131, \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc92c\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static\nrepresentations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),\nare efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program\nwill behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic\nrepresentations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights\ninto performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks\ndue to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends\nthis trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program\nrepresentation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization\nsensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation\ngenerated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization\nsequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To\neffectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a\ncompositional learning approach.

This\nlimitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To\naddress this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline\nand (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a\ndataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based\npipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we\npropose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the\narchitectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the\nstructural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes\ninto coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input\nlevel, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For\ninstance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens \"not\" and\n\"girl\" as simply \"girl\", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning\nis correctly distinguished from that of \"girl\" alone. This module is integrated\nwith a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method\nsignificantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a\nlowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval\nand demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step\nforward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoVAND\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cNegToMe\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaCoVAND\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f00\u53d1NegToMe\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d1f\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, their adversarial\nrobustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial\npatch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first\nintroduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic\nadversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the\ncamera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided\nSynthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate\ncounterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label\nintegrity.

Existing studies often pre-process raw training\ndatasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or\noff-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining\nwhether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data\nquality through individual influence on validation data using our newly\nproposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring\npresent in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is\ninherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits\none model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data\nselection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we\nintroduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally\nsimpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model\ndependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for\npreference data selection.

Generative artificial\nintelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent\ninteraction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In\npractice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)\nConstructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering\nself-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance\nremains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and\nsolution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system\noperability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and\nadaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex\nscenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective\ncollaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The\nopen-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,\nhampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored\nfor industrial applications.

Unlike\nconventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the\nimage as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the\nimage reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes\nan encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked\nlow-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to\nidentify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to\nreconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the\npre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive\nlearning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration\ntasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained\nencoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve\noutstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves\nperformance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with\na minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and\na 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation\nscenarios.

To mitigate this, recent methods\nemploy a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,\nbased on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains\nconsistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely\nfocused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean\naggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,\nwe argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean\naggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a\nsimple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time\napproach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases\nwith negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a\nnovel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,\nwhich incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18\ndatasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x\nrespectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These\nresults set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for\noptimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk\nmanagement.

Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve\ninformation recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources\nand follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to\npreserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn\ndialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we\npropose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn\ndialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,\nstructured representation of the conversational context.

The\nmethod abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts\ntemporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a\ngraph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for\ncontext-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then\nintroduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the\nseparability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.\nFurthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain\nrepresentation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term\nfluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and\ntemporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across\nmulti-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically\nevaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity\nperspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms\nexisting methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,\nwhile maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring\nnoise, and traffic fluctuations.

When dropout is informative (i.e.,\ndependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which\ntreatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an\nassumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring\nbias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as\nnon-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial\nidentification to derive informative bounds on the CATE.

However, existing methods often suffer from limited\ngeneralization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature\nof Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed\nLarge-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages\nthe semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture\nrepresentation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures\ngeometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and\nDoppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale\nSemantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with\ngesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance\ncategory discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme\nthat encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially\nfor semantically similar gestures.

These models typically\nrely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture\nuser intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording\nnecessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,\nleading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on\nreal-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%\nwith minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),\nproviding a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device\nML.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaLog\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub85c\uadf8\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc81c\uac70\uc640 \uc800\uc7a5 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 44%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc784.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571 \ub0b4 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc800\uc7a5 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc751\ub2f5\uc131 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c \ubc1c\uc0dd.", "method": "\uc911\ubcf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uac70, \uc774\uc885 \uc18d\uc131 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubd84\uc0b0, \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub85c\uadf8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654.", "result": "\ub85c\uadf8 \ud06c\uae30 19%\uc5d0\uc11c 44%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc800\uac10, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654, \uc628-\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 ML \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ucd09\uc9c4.", "conclusion": "AdaLog\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub85c\uadf8\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc5ec \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub2e4."}}

Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale\nthe diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural\noverhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and\nunmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural\nconsistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention\nmechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity\nthrough adaptive feature fusion.

Experiments demonstrate that\nPatch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but\nalso achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and\nPhoto-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both\nperceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Patch-Adapter\ub294 4K \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc138\ubd80 \ub514\ud14c\uc77c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5", "method": "\uc774\uc911 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub0ae\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 Dual Context Adapter\uc640 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub514\ud14c\uc77c\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 Reference Patch Adapter\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9", "result": "4K+ \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc548\ub0b4\uc640 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud37c\ud3ec\uba3c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud488\uc9c8 \ub2ec\uc131", "conclusion": "Patch-Adapter\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub514\ud14c\uc77c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568"}}

Nevertheless, most methods\noften assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when\nthese models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative\nperception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align\nneighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise\nfrom domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.\nMoreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which\ncauses the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these\nissues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages\nDomain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.\nThe CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight\nSpatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation\n(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)\nloss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the\nneighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight\nconvolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution\ndiscrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation\nmodules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter\ncaptures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the\nmutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain\nseparation process.

Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking\nspots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,\nparking policy, and urban development.

A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)\nproperty, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In\npractice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally\nexpensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose\ndimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS\nexpression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis\nhave been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented\nalgorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer\nmodel that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,\nthereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP.

The investigation is conducted\nthrough four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results\nwere inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,\nthis thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages.

Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if\none were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as\n\"generator\" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D\nreconstruction system as \"decoder\". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework\nthat does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components\nmust be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their\nweights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D\ndecoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the\ntext-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation\nrequires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video\ngenerator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the\ngenerated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D\nscene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular\ntechnique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A\napproach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models.

All three metrics operate without additional\nmodel training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive\ngeometric verification.

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA\nintroduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into\nquery-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while\npreserving the same attention computation as used during training.

However,\nexisting TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major\nchallenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving\nmulti-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal\noperators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal\nknowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured\ngrounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime\ndecomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,\nenabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and\nco-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic\nevidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval\nstrategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning\ntraces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.\nComprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime\nachieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by\nup to 24.0%.

The key building blocks of\nour pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion\npipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically\ncorrect surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed\nimplicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural\nrepresentations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which\nemploys a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --\ninspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit\nbreast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural\nSDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our\nsurface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for\nlocalized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of\nreconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its\nglobal counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to\nrecover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2\nmm.

However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform\ntheir text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language\nunderstanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:\nthe performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs\nrelative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.\nRecent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech\nsynthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic\ndata, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not\nreproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient\nalternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap.

The goal\nof the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\\textit{regret}$\ncompared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm\nknowing all functions of the sequence in advance.\n  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective\nOCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has\nto choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are\nrevealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,\nwe consider the $\\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline\nalgorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the\nmaximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the\n$K$ sequences.

However, most existing approaches rely solely on\nvisual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as\nocclusion, low illumination, and adverse weather.

To address these limitations, this study\npresents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition\nframework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main\nmodules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion\nstrategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal\nrelationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model\nextracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both\nlocal and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion\nmechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional\nNetwork (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the\nfused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning.

Building on AnomalyDINO, a\ntraining-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present\none of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty\nestimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while\npreserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen\nDINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we\nevaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe\nconsistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible\nperturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce\nconfident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and\nfind that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between\nconfidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong\nbaseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly\nscores for uncertainty estimation.

A natural\napproach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with\nfoundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the\nrestrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into\nexisting iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,\nwe propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation\nmodels to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset\nprior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level\nediting via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D\nreconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,\nEditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies\nconsistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward\nreconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the\npipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates\nprompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently\nacross images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and\ncompare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating\nsuperior editing quality and high efficiency.

To address this\nissue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with\nCalibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced\nClassification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority\nclasses using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components\nfrom both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is\ntrained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent\ndisentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are\nused to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration\nstrategy.

To address these issues, we\npropose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant\ninformation to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that\nreward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent\nspace, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.\nMotivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that\npenalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape\nwhile maintaining alignment.

While conventional approaches typically retrain the model\nto recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the\nper-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full\nretraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,\nfinding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it\nto optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics\nthat ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective.

To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision\nProcesses (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but\nwhere transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent\nadvances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this\nlatent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to\ndetermine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now\naddressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages\nclustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed\neffectively speed up learning.\n  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first\nlearns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an\noptimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm\nachieves a regret that is $O(\\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible\nto clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the\ncardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\\cdot)$ holds\nup to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior\nbound, $O(\\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large.

We present the first large-scale\nsystematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a\nprincipled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit\nsigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of\ncommon design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and\ncompute efficiency.

A central challenge in this setting lies in\nutilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment\nwith the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual\nConditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs\nthe CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous\nframes. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively\nrestricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the\ndiffusion process.

By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations.

Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B\nmodel on Honey-Data-15M.

Based on this principle, we propose representing\nany video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D\ntrajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this\nrepresentation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the\nentire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each\npixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that\nparameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at\narbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on\nlarge-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments\ndemonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nour new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on\nestablished point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency\ngains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization\nor auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including\ngoal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.\nProject page: https://trace-anything.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1 \ub0b4 \ud53d\uc140\uc758 3D \uc6b4\ub3d9\uada4\uc801\uc744 Dense Trajectory Field\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub2e8 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 Trace Anything \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud53d\uc140\ubcc4 3D \uada4\uc801 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c Trajectory Field\ub97c Dense\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc778 Trace Anything\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc810 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e0\uaddc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc810 \ucd94\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucdc4\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc870\uc791, \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc608\uce21 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Trajectory Field \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud328\uc2a4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc601\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4."}}

To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios.
